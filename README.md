Revisiting the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC). [Challenge Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00001)

* How to deal with missing values in time series?
* Can a Transformer-based network reach a reasonable classification score?
* How does the performance compare with some Seq2Seq or 1D convolution?
